If your app crashes immediately upon launch, here are some common reasons and suggestions for resolving them:

1. Incompatible Device or OS Version
   -Solution: Check if your app is compatible with the device's operating system. Update the app or device to the latest version if necessary.

2. Corrupted Installation
   -Solution: Uninstall and then reinstall the app. This can resolve issues caused by corrupted files during the initial installation.

3. Insufficient Device Resources
   -Solution: Ensure the device has enough RAM and storage available. Close other apps running in the background to free up resources.

4. Missing or Incorrect Permissions
   -Solution: Verify that the app has the necessary permissions to run. Check the app settings in the deviceâ€™s settings menu and grant any required permissions.

5. Bugs in the Code
   -Solution: If you're the developer, review the code for any exceptions or errors that could cause the app to crash. Utilize debugging tools to identify and fix these issues.

By addressing these areas, you can often identify and resolve the cause of your app crashing immediately.
