Here’s a rephrased version:

Incomplete Download: If Windows update files fail to download properly, it can result in the error message, “Windows couldn’t complete the updates.”

Insufficient Disk Space: Installing Windows updates typically requires some free disk space.
If your device doesn’t have enough available space, the updates won’t install, which can trigger this error.

Corrupted System Files: Corruption in system files can prevent the update installation from proceeding correctly, often leading to the “We couldn’t complete the updates. Undoing changes” message.

Interrupted Update Process: Interrupting the update process, such as by force-shutting down your computer, can stop the update and potentially corrupt system files. 
This can also result in incomplete downloads, as some files may still be in the process of downloading.
